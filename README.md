# Genomic Data Analysis by Python 

-- In this repository I have included several scripts on Python programming language which I wrote to make program for genomic data analysis.--For exampl--
-- 1.The program gets the DNA sequence  from the user and calculate  the length and number of nucleotides.--2.The program gets the DNA sequence from the user and calculate the GC content.-- 3.The program predict the fragment length if we digest the sequence with the AbcI restriction enzyme whose recognition site is ANT/AAT
